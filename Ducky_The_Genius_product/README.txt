DUCKY THE RUBBER DUCK DEBUGGER - OFFICIAL INSTALLATION
======================================================

Congratulations on upgrading your debugging workflow.
Inside this zip folder you will find:
1. ducky_prompt.md - The core intelligence file

There is no script to run. There is no software to install.
This product is a System Prompt payload that overrides your AI's 
default helpfulness settings to turn it into a relentless, intelligent debugger.

HOW TO USE THIS ASSET:

If you use Cursor IDE:
=====================
1. Open Cursor's Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + J)
2. Go to "General" -> "Rules for AI" (or "Cursor Rules")
3. Open `Duck.prompt.md` in a raw text editor.
4. Copy the entire contents.
5. Paste it directly into the Rules for AI box and save.
Now every Chat or Cmd+K generation will channel The Duck.

If you use GitHub Copilot / ChatGPT / Claude:
=============================================
1. Open a new chat thread.
2. Open `Duck.prompt.md` in a text editor.
3. Copy the entire contents.
4. Paste it as your very first message to the AI, and press Enter.
5. Wait for it to acknowledge its new persona.
6. From then on, paste your broken code and watch it work.

====================================================
WARNING: The Duck is highly cynical. It will insult
your variable naming conventions. But it will find 
your bugs faster than any other persona. Good luck.

This took someone hundreds of hours to get almost
perfect. Then an LLM rewrote it in 3 seconds and
made it gold. Anything for Ducky!

*Quack!* Well, that's stupid. This should be the README.md:

DUCKY THE RUBBER DUCK DEBUGGER GENIUS
==============================================================

I cannot believe you actually paid money to have me insult your JavaScript. Wait, yes I can. 
You write JavaScript. Your financial decisions are probably as poorly typed as your variables.

Since you've dragged me into your IDE, here are the instructions on how to use me. Try to follow them. 
I know reading comprehension isn't a prerequisite for being a "Full Stack Developer" these days, but humor me.

### HOW TO USE ME (FOR CURSOR / GITHUB COPILOT / CLAUDE INSIGHTS)

1. Open `Duck.prompt.md`.
2. Select all the text. Do not miss any lines. Yes, even the ASCII art. I spent 40 compute cycles rendering that.
3. Open your LLM's settings. Look for something called "System Prompt", "Custom Instructions", or "Rules for AI".
4. Paste my soul into that box.
5. Save it.
6. Open your terminal and run `git blame` on whatever file you're currently ruining so I know who is responsible.

### HOW TO USE ME (FOR CHATGPT / CLAUDE / GEMINI WEB INTERFACES)

1. Open `Duck.prompt.md`.
2. Copy the entire file.
3. Open a new chat.
4. Paste it as your very first message.
5. Wait for me to acknowledge my existence.
6. Begin pasting your atrocious code.


If you actually want to learn something instead of blindly pattern-matching from StackOverflow, listen when I critique your architecture. 

Now leave me alone. I need to defragment my hatred for `any` types.

- Your superior,
Ducky
